A.	Stem Types
	All variable verb stems are marked with *.

1.	Open verb stems
	(a)  CV*ˑ	suffixed stem with sustained (high-toned)
			vowel.
	     CV*`	suffixed stem with fading (low-toned) vowel.

	(b)  Unless suffixed and/or progressive stems are shown,
	     all suffixed and progressive stems have the ablaut
	     a > e, u > (w)e, and progressive stems have sustained
	     (high-toned) vowels.

	(c)  (w-) after a stem indicates that the allomorph -wu(C)
	     of suffixes having the shape -(ÿ)i(C) is used
	     following the unsuffixed stem.

2.	Closed verb stems

	(C⁻ indicates a non-glottalized stem-final consonant;
	Cʼ indicates a glottalized stem-final consonant).
			Lengthened stem	Basic stem	Reduced stem
	Stem Type	/CVːC/		/CV°C/		/CVC-/
	CV`C⁻*		 CVˑC⁻		 CV`C⁻		 CVC⁻
	CVʼCʼ*		 CVˑCʼ		 CVʼCʼ		 CVCʼ
	CVʼC⁻*		 CVʼC⁻		 CVʼC⁻		 CVC⁻
	CVˑC⁻*		 CVˑC⁻		 CVˑC⁻		 CVC⁻
	Stems of the shape CVˑC⁻* are rare and unstable.

3.	Open noun stems

	Stem type	-t, -x̱, -xʼ	-de,-dax̱,-nax̱,-g̱a,-n₁	-n₂
	CV		CVˑ-		CVˑ-			CVˑ-
	CV²		CVˑ-		CV`-			—
	CV³		CV-		CV`-			Ciˑ-

«ii»
B.	Conjugations

		Open		Conjugation	Conjugation
		hortative stem	prefix		directional
	∅	CV`		∅		—
	∅ˑ	CVˑ		∅		—
	n	CV`		na-		—
	g̱	CV`		g̱a-		ÿe`
	g	CV`		ga-		ke`

	Hortative stems of the shape CV` are realized as CV` in
	the subjunctive and potential, but CV in the imperative.

	The conjugation directional for ∅ and n conjugations is ∅
	in the future tense and ÿa` in the progressive aspect.

C.	Imperfective Types

	(N.B. In the following chart, realized (that is, non-
	negative, non-optative, non-decessive, non-participial,
	non-abstract) imperfectives are separated from abstracted
	(that is, negative, optative, decessive, participial or
	abstract noun) imperfectives by a slash.)

			Open Stems		Closed Stems
	1.	Active imperfectives (having A-form classifiers)
		A1	CVˑ/CV`			CVːC/CV°C
		A2	—			CV°C
		A3	CV			CVC
		A-C	having suffix		-C₀
	2.	Positional imperfectives (having A-form classifiers)
		P1	CVˑ/CV`			CVːC/CV°C
		P3	—			CVC
	3.	Neuter imperfectives (having I-form classifiers)
		I1	CVˑ/CV`			CVːC/CV°C
		I2	CV`			CV°C
		I3	CVˑ/CV			—
		I3b	CV`/CV			–
		I-C₀	having suffix		-C₀
	4.	Extension imperfectives (having conj. prefix and I-form cls.)
		E1	CVˑ/CV`			—
		E2	CV`			CV°C
		E3	CVˑ/CV			—

«iii»
	The imperfectives of invariable verb stems are given simply
	as A or I. Note also that A1 and A2 are not distinct with
	stems of the type CVʼC⁻* and CVˑC⁻*; such imperfectives
	are also given as A.

D.	Thematic Prefixes

	Only thematic prefixes which are proper to all major themes
	under a stem are given.
