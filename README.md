# Tlingit Roots

This is a collection of documented roots and other parts of speech in the
Tlingit language, meant for reference and linguistic research. The structure of
the file is very simple so that it can be easily parsed by text processing
tools. The contents are derived from Leer’s stem and verb documentation.

* Leer 1976: http://www.uaf.edu/anla/item.xml?id=TL962L1975n
* Leer 1978: http://www.uaf.edu/anla/item.xml?id=TL962L1975m

This collection is meant to be exhaustive for verb roots, but not for nouns.
Compounding and other nominal morphology make the noun inventory potentially
far larger than the verb root inventory. Most if not all monomorphemic nouns
are represented, but only a selection of interesting nouns of other kinds
are included.

The coverage of other parts of speech aims to be exhaustive. Particular
emphasis is given to interjections, directionals, underived adjectives,
underived adverbs, postpositions, pronouns, determiners, and demonstratives.

Names are included mostly to illustrate otherwise rare lexical items. The
majority of included names are ethnonyms, clan names, and place names.
Personal names are generally limited to legendary and mythical figures.

## Structure

The structure of the roots list is very simple. Each entry is a single line.
Each line is divided into three columns separated by tabs. The first column
is the entry datum. The second column contains a part of speech label in the
list given below. The third column contains a definition and other
assorted information.
