# Tlingit Roots

This is a collection of documented roots and other parts of speech in the
Tlingit language, meant for reference and linguistic research. The structure of
the file is very simple so that it can be easily parsed by text processing
tools. The contents are derived from Leer’s stem and verb documentation.

* Leer 1973: http://www.uaf.edu/anla/item.xml?id=TL962L1973g
* Leer 1976: http://www.uaf.edu/anla/item.xml?id=TL962L1975n
* Leer 1978: http://www.uaf.edu/anla/item.xml?id=TL962L1975m

This collection is meant to be exhaustive for verb roots, but not for nouns.
Compounding and other nominal morphology make the noun inventory potentially
far larger than the verb root inventory. Most if not all monomorphemic nouns
are represented, but only a selection of interesting nouns of other kinds
are included.

The coverage of other parts of speech aims to be exhaustive. Particular
emphasis is given to interjections, directionals, underived adjectives,
underived adverbs, postpositions, pronouns, determiners, and demonstratives.

Names are included mostly to illustrate otherwise rare lexical items. The
majority of included names are ethnonyms, clan names, and place names.
Personal names are generally limited to legendary and mythical figures.

## Structure

The structure of the roots list is very simple. Each entry is a single line.
Each line is divided into three columns separated by tabs. The first column
is the entry datum. The second column contains a part of speech label in the
list given below. The third column contains a definition and other
assorted information.

### Parts of speech

* `root` – a verb root
* `noun` – a noun or noun-like word
* `adj` – an adjective that modifies a noun
* `adv` – an adverb that modifies a verb
* `pron` – a pronoun, including pronominal prefixes of the verb
* `det` – a determiner
* `pcl` – a grammatical particle
* `dirn` – a directional word
* `ppn` – a postposition or a postpositional phrase
* `aux` – an auxiliary verb
* `affix` – an affix not identifiable as a separate word
* `interj` – an interjection or exclamation
* `name` – a proper name of a place, person, etc.

## Representation of roots

Tlingit roots form two classes: variable and invariable. These two classes and
their various subclasses are represented in the roots list with particular
orthographic conventions. These conventions differ slightly from the
orthography used for the rest of the language.

Variable roots have multiple surface forms that depend on phonological and
inflectional context. The variation in surface forms is mostly tone and length.
Variable roots do not have an underlying specification of either tone or
length, so their representations are not pronounceable forms. In contrast,
invariable roots have one surface form regardless of context. The
representations of invariable roots are therefore pronounceable.

The following list illustrates the representation of invariable roots. Note the
use of a grave accent to indicate low tone where it might be ambiguous. This is
omitted where there is a high tone vowel in a neighbouring syllable.

* `√tsàa` [tsʰàː] CV̀V̀
* `√dzée` [tsíː] CV́V́
* `√.àas` [ʔàːs] CV̀V̀C
* `√ÿáash` [ɰáːʃ] CV́V́C
* `√hélʼk` [héɬʼk] CV́CC
* `√náalx̱` [náːɬχ] CV́V́CC
* `√háachʼi` [háːtʃʼì] CV́V́CV̀
* `√haakʼú` [hàːkʼʷú] CV̀V̀CV́
* `√ÿaax̱áḵw` [ɰàːχáqʷ] CV̀V̀CV́C
* `√tlʼéekʼát` [tɬʼíːkʼát] CV́V́CV́C

The following list illustrates the representation of variable roots. Note the
lack of tone on the vowels.

* `√tla` /tɬʰa/ CV
* `√tlaʰ` /tɬʰa/ CVʰ
* `√tan` /tʰan/ CVC
* `√taʼw` /tʰaw/ CVʼC

The CVʰ roots differ from CV roots in appearing in suffixed forms with low tone
where high tone would otherwise be expected. The CVʼC roots differ from CVC
roots in having high tone where low tone would otherwise be expected.
The representations are due to Tongass Tlingit where CVʰ roots had breathy
vowels instead of plain vowels, and CVʼC roots had glottalized vowels instead
of plain vowels.
